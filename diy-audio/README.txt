The OSSC does not output audio over HDMI or DVI-D, respectively. This add on captures the analoge audio you feed over the SCART or audio 3.5mm stereo jack. The audio signal is digitalize and put into the IT6613E over the I2S audio interface.

Firmware
========
The IT6613E has to be programmed appropriately to insert audio to the digital video output. In the 'original' firmware audio is not taken into account. Therefore the firmware of the OSSC has to be updated.
You can grab the current firmware here: https://github.com/borti4938/ossc/tree/diy-audio/diy-audio/fw-build
I do my best to keep the firmware synchronized with updates by marqs85. However, as marqs includes more and more features to the firmware there might be a point where I have to cut features due to the lack of memory space.


PCB Production
==============
Choose the service you would ever like. I have uploaded the design to OSHPark, too.
VERY IMPORTANT: The substrate thickness has to be as thin as possible.
The PCB is design to sit between lifted pins of the IT6613 (the HDMI transmitter) and OSSC-PCB. Just look at the installation pictures to get an idea ;)
I have produced the PCBs with OSHPark and have chosen 0.8mm thickness. The PCB must not be thicker.

RC-filtering of the Audio
=========================
The RC filters (R19,C19) and (R20,C20) mainly bandlimits the noise. The filter also avoids aliasing effects if the bandwith of the audio signal increases.
The PCM1808 samples the audio signal with 96kHz. This means that the cut-off frequency of the filters have to be 96kHz or below. The firmware will also allows you to further downsample the datastream to 48kHz. If you want to use that I recommend you to set the filter to 48kHz or below to avoid aliasing.
The cut-off frequency f_c of a simple RC low pass filter is determined by f_c = 1/(2*pi*R*C).
here is my choice which gives a cut-off frequency of 47.938kHz.

PCB-Installation
=================
(see pictures; assumes that at least the SCART connector has been desoldered)
01 - v1.3 - bend up pins 9, 10 and 11 of the IT6613 (v1.3 only!!!)
   - v1.5 - cut three wires between each pair of solder joints marked with I2S, WS and SCK (v1.5 only)
02 - make a placement check (might look different between v1.3 and v1.5)
03 - cut off the plastic around pin 2, 4 and 6 of the SCART connector if needed
04 - solder the IT6613 into place (if not done yet) and approximately fix the audio pcb into place (v1.5 does not sit under some pins)
05 - solder the SCART plug into place and solder the audio PCB onto the SCART connector (remind to check the pin assignment at the IT6613 during soldering the first leg)
06 - v1.3 - solder pin 9, 10 and 11 of the IT6613 onto the audio PCB (v1.3 only)
   - v1.5 - solder the three top solder joints on the OSSC PCB (I2S, WS and SCK) to the DIY audio PCB (v1.5 only)
07 - connect the wires
08 - 5V and 3.3V can be get from U5
09 - 27MHz from the crystal oscillator (pin between U7 and U9)
